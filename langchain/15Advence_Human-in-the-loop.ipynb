Here are several approaches depending on your database system and requirements:\\n\\n## SQL Examples\\n\\n### 1. MySQL/MariaDB\\n```sql\\n-- Delete records older than 30 days\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);\\n\\n-- Delete with limit to avoid locking issues\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_at < \\'2023-01-01\\' \\nLIMIT 1000;\\n```\\n\\n### 2. PostgreSQL\\n```sql\\n-- Delete records older than 30 days\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL \\'30 days\\';\\n\\n-- Using date column\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE date_column < CURRENT_DATE - 30;\\n```\\n\\n### 3. SQL Server\\n```sql\\n-- Delete records older than 30 days\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_at < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n```\\n\\n## Programming Language Examples\\n\\n### Python with SQLAlchemy\\n```python\\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, text\\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\\n\\n# Database connection\\nengine = create_engine(\\'your_database_url\\')\\n\\n# Delete records older than 30 days\\ncutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)\\n\\nwith engine.connect() as connection:\\n    # For better performance with large datasets\\n    query = text(\"\"\"\\n        DELETE FROM your_table \\n        WHERE created_at < :cutoff_date\\n        LIMIT 1000\\n    \"\"\")\\n    \\n    result = connection.execute(query, {\\'cutoff_date\\': cutoff_date})\\n    connection.commit()\\n    print(f\"Deleted {result.rowcount} records\")\\n```\\n\\n### PHP with PDO\\n```php\\n<?php\\ntry {\\n    $pdo = new PDO(\"mysql:host=localhost;dbname=your_db\", \"username\", \"password\");\\n    $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\\n    \\n    $cutoff_date = date(\\'Y-m-d H:i:s\\', strtotime(\\'-30 days\\'));\\n    \\n    $stmt = $pdo->prepare(\"DELETE FROM your_table WHERE created_at < :cutoff_date LIMIT 1000\");\\n    $stmt->bindParam(\\':cutoff_date\\', $cutoff_date);\\n    $stmt->execute();\\n    \\n    echo \"Deleted \" . $stmt->rowCount() . \" records\";\\n    \\n} catch(PDOException $e) {\\n    echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\\n}\\n?>\\n```\\n\\n## Best Practices\\n\\n### 1. Always Backup First\\n```sql\\n-- Create backup of records to be deleted\\nCREATE TABLE your_table_backup AS \\nSELECT * FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Use Batches for Large Datasets\\n```sql\\n-- Delete in batches to avoid table locks\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE id IN (\\n    SELECT id FROM your_table \\n    WHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) \\n    LIMIT 1000\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Archive Instead of Delete (Recommended)\\n```sql\\n-- Move to archive table instead of deleting\\nINSERT INTO archive_table \\nSELECT * FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);\\n\\n-- Then delete from main table\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);\\n```\\n\\n## Scheduled Cleanup\\n\\n### Cron Job Example\\n```bash\\n# Add to crontab (runs daily at 2 AM)\\n0 2 * * * /usr/bin/mysql -u username -p password -e \"DELETE FROM your_db.your_table WHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) LIMIT 5000;\"\\n```\\n\\n### Stored Procedure for Scheduled Cleanup\\n```sql\\nDELIMITER $$\\nCREATE PROCEDURE CleanupOldRecords()\\nBEGIN\\n    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;\\n    DECLARE rows_affected INT;\\n    \\n    REPEAT\\n        DELETE FROM your_table \\n        WHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) \\n        LIMIT 1000;\\n        \\n        SET rows_affected = ROW_COUNT();\\n    UNTIL rows_affected = 0 END REPEAT;\\nEND$$\\nDELIMITER ;\\n```\\n\\n## Safety Measures\\n\\n1. **Always test on a development database first**\\n2. **Take a backup before running delete operations**\\n3. **Use transactions when possible**\\n4. **Consider soft deletes (is_deleted flag) instead of hard deletes**\\n5. **Monitor performance impact**\\n\\nWould you like me to provide a specific example for your database system or use case?', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1015, 'prompt_tokens': 17, 'total_tokens': 1032, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 0, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 17}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'deepseek-chat', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ffc7281d48_prod0820_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'e5f2494b-446c-49f2-8561-fc0bfcabf490', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--fe514e3e-0ac6-4120-95ed-508b58080b33-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 17, 'output_tokens': 1015, 'total_tokens': 1032, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {}}),\n",

       "  AIMessage(content='I\\'ll provide you with comprehensive solutions for deleting old records from a database. Here are multiple approaches:\\n\\n## Basic SQL Solutions\\n\\n### 1. Delete by Date Range\\n```sql\\n-- Delete records older than 30 days\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n\\n-- Or for MySQL\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);\\n\\n-- Or for PostgreSQL\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_date < NOW() - INTERVAL \\'30 days\\';\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Delete by Specific Date\\n```sql\\n-- Delete records before a specific date\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_date < \\'2023-01-01\\';\\n```\\n\\n## Safe Deletion Practices\\n\\n### 1. Always Backup First\\n```sql\\n-- Create backup of records to be deleted\\nSELECT * INTO your_table_backup \\nFROM your_table \\nWHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Test with SELECT First\\n```sql\\n-- See what will be deleted\\nSELECT COUNT(*) \\nFROM your_table \\nWHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n\\n-- See the actual records\\nSELECT * \\nFROM your_table \\nWHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE())\\nORDER BY created_date DESC;\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Use Transactions\\n```sql\\nBEGIN TRANSACTION;\\n\\n-- Check how many rows will be affected\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_table WHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n\\n-- If correct, proceed with delete\\nDELETE FROM your_table WHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n\\n-- Verify results, then commit or rollback\\nCOMMIT;\\n-- OR if something went wrong: ROLLBACK;\\n```\\n\\n## Batch Deletion for Large Tables\\n\\n### 1. Delete in Batches (SQL Server)\\n```sql\\nDECLARE @RowsAffected INT = 1;\\n\\nWHILE @RowsAffected > 0\\nBEGIN\\n    DELETE TOP (1000) FROM your_table \\n    WHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n    \\n    SET @RowsAffected = @@ROWCOUNT;\\nEND\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Batch Delete with MySQL\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) \\nLIMIT 1000;\\n```\\n\\n### 3. PostgreSQL Batch Delete\\n```sql\\nWITH deleted AS (\\n    DELETE FROM your_table \\n    WHERE created_date < NOW() - INTERVAL \\'30 days\\'\\n    RETURNING *\\n)\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM deleted;\\n```\\n\\n## Programming Language Examples\\n\\n### Python\\n```python\\nimport pyodbc\\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\\n\\ndef delete_old_records():\\n    try:\\n        conn = pyodbc.connect(\\'your_connection_string\\')\\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\\n        \\n        # Calculate cutoff date (30 days ago)\\n        cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)\\n        \\n        # Delete records\\n        cursor.execute(\"\"\"\\n            DELETE FROM your_table \\n            WHERE created_date < ?\\n        \"\"\", cutoff_date)\\n        \\n        conn.commit()\\n        print(f\"Deleted {cursor.rowcount} records\")\\n        \\n    except Exception as e:\\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\\n        conn.rollback()\\n    finally:\\n        conn.close()\\n```\\n\\n### PHP\\n```php\\n<?php\\ntry {\\n    $pdo = new PDO(\"mysql:host=localhost;dbname=your_db\", \"username\", \"password\");\\n    $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\\n    \\n    $cutoff_date = date(\\'Y-m-d H:i:s\\', strtotime(\\'-30 days\\'));\\n    \\n    $stmt = $pdo->prepare(\"DELETE FROM your_table WHERE created_date < :cutoff_date\");\\n    $stmt->bindParam(\\':cutoff_date\\', $cutoff_date);\\n    $stmt->execute();\\n    \\n    echo \"Deleted \" . $stmt->rowCount() . \" records\";\\n    \\n} catch(PDOException $e) {\\n    echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\\n}\\n?>\\n```\\n\\n## Advanced Scenarios\\n\\n### 1. Archive Instead of Delete\\n```sql\\n-- Move to archive table first\\nINSERT INTO archive_table \\nSELECT * FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n\\n-- Then delete from main table\\nDELETE FROM your_table \\nWHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Delete with Relationships\\n```sql\\n-- Delete child records first\\nDELETE FROM child_table \\nWHERE parent_id IN (\\n    SELECT id FROM parent_table \\n    WHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE())\\n);\\n\\n-- Then delete parent records\\nDELETE FROM parent_table \\nWHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Scheduled Cleanup Job\\n```sql\\n-- Create stored procedure for scheduled cleanup\\nCREATE PROCEDURE sp_CleanupOldRecords\\nAS\\nBEGIN\\n    SET NOCOUNT ON;\\n    \\n    DECLARE @BatchSize INT = 1000;\\n    DECLARE @RowsAffected INT = 1;\\n    \\n    WHILE @RowsAffected > 0\\n    BEGIN\\n        DELETE TOP (@BatchSize) FROM your_table \\n        WHERE created_date < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());\\n        \\n        SET @RowsAffected = @@ROWCOUNT;\\n        \\n        -- Wait to reduce load\\n        WAITFOR DELAY \\'00:00:01\\';\\n    END\\nEND\\n```\\n\\n## Cron Job Example (Linux)\\n```bash\\n# Add to crontab - runs daily at 2 AM\\n0 2 * * * /usr/bin/mysql -u username -p\\'password\\' -e \"DELETE FROM your_db.your_table WHERE created_date < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) LIMIT 5000;\"\\n```\\n\\n## Critical Safety Checklist\\n\\n1. **✅ Backup database before deletion**\\n2. **✅ Test with SELECT statement first**\\n3. **✅ Use transactions when possible**\\n4. **✅ Consider archiving instead of permanent deletion**\\n5. **✅ Verify your WHERE clause carefully**\\n6. **✅ Monitor performance impact**\\n7. **✅ Have a rollback plan**\\n\\n## Quick Template\\nReplace the placeholders and run this first to test:\\n```sql\\n-- TEST FIRST\\nSELECT COUNT(*) as \\'Records to delete\\' \\nFROM [your_table_name] \\nWHERE [date_column] < DATEADD(day, -[days_old], GETDATE());\\n\\n-- THEN DELETE\\nDELETE FROM [your_table_name] \\nWHERE [date_column] < DATEADD(day, -[days_old], GETDATE());\\n```\\n\\n**Which database system are you using, and what specific criteria do you want to use for determining \"old\" records?**', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1465, 'prompt_tokens': 1042, 'total_tokens': 2507, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 960}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 960, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 82}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'deepseek-chat', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ffc7281d48_prod0820_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '57bcc85d-ee89-471e-b3fe-fa00da721df0', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--7a28f412-ccb4-49e3-aa36-5e8a2edd05e3-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1042, 'output_tokens': 1465, 'total_tokens': 2507, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 960}, 'output_token_details': {}}),\n",

FIRST, CHECK WHAT WILL BE DELETED\\nSELECT COUNT(*) as \\'Records that will be deleted\\' \\nFROM your_table_name \\nWHERE created_date_column < NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;\\n\\n-- 2. THEN, DELETE THE RECORDS\\nDELETE FROM your_table_name \\nWHERE created_date_column < NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;\\n```\\n\\n## ⚠️ **Critical Safety Notes**\\n\\n1. **Always backup your database first**\\n2. **Test on development/staging environment**\\n3. **Use transactions for safety**\\n4. **Consider archiving instead of permanent deletion**\\n5. **Monitor database performance during large deletions**\\n\\n**Which specific database and table structure are you working with?
